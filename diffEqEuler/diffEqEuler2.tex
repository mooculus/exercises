Let $f$ be a function with $f(1) = 1$, and $f$ is a solution to the differential equation 
\[
\dd[y]{x} = xy
\]
Follow the following set of steps (called ``Euler's method'') to approximate $f(1.2)$:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Find an approximate value of $f(1.1)$ by using the
          linear approximation at $(1,1)$.  Call this approximation
          $y_1$, so $(1.1,y_1)$ is close to being on the graph of $f$.
	\item Use the linear approximation at $(1.1,y_1)$ to
          approximate the value of $f(1.2)$.  Call this $y_2$, so that
          $(1.2,y_2)$ is appoximately on the curve.
	\end{itemize}
This is an example of a ``numerical method'' for approximating a
solution to a differential equation.
