\outcome{Identify where a function is and is not continuous.}

Give intervals on which each of the following functions are
continuous. Write combinations of intervals going from left to right
on the number line.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\frac{1}{e^x+1}$ is continuous on $(\answer{-\infty},\answer{\infty})$.
\item $\frac{1}{x^2-1}$ is continuous on $(\answer{-\infty},\answer{-1})$ and $(\answer{-1},\answer{1})$ and $(\answer{1},\answer{\infty})$.
\item $\sqrt{5-x}$ is continuous on $(\answer{-\infty},\answer{5})$.
\item $\sqrt{5-x^2}$ is continuous on $(\answer{-\sqrt{5}},\answer{\sqrt{5}})$.
\end{enumerate}
