A standard soda can is roughly cylindrical and holds $355$cm$^3$ of liquid. What dimensions should the cylinder be to minimize absolutely the material needed to produce the can? (Recall that the surface area of a cylinder with its caps included is given by $S=2\pi r h+2\pi r^2$ where $h$ is its height and $r$ is the radius of its base, and its volume is given by $V=\pi r^2 h$).
\begin{enumerate}
\item		The radius should be\[r=\answer{\left(\frac{355}{2\pi}\right)^{1/3}}\,cm.\]
\item		The height should be \[h=\answer{2^{1/3}\left(\frac{710}{\pi}\right)^{1/3}}\,cm.\]
\end{enumerate}
