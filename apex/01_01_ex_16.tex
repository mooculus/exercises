% The r@{.}l aligns everything at a common decimal point by constructing two columns and 
% aligning them together at that decimal point to create the effect that only a single column is
% there. It's a quick fix to a very minor blemish in the source.

% We need the multicolumn{2}{c} to align the 'h' over the center of the two columns we have     
% made, since we cannot just change the number of columns midway through our construction. 
% By indicating that there are 2 columns we are merging, TeX understands our construction.

% I have to  put extra columns into this one, else the RHS doesn't line up quite right. Better way to 
% do this?



Let $f(x) =\ln(x)$ and $a=5$. Observe the table of values for $\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{r@{.}lc@{\hspace{30pt}}r@{.}l}
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{$h$} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{$\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$}\\ \hline 
  $-0$ & $1$ & & $0$ & $202027$  \\
  $-0$ & $01$ & & $0$ & $2002$ \\
  $0$ & $01$ & & $0$ & $1998$ \\
  $0$ & $1$ & & $0$ & $198026$
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Estimate the limit as $h\to 0$: $\begin{prompt}\answer{0.2}\end{prompt}$
