A power line is to be run to an offshore facility which is $2$ miles at sea and $5$ miles along the shoreline from the power plant. It costs \$$50,000$ per mile to lay a power line underground and \$$80,000$ to run the line underwater.

What is absolute minimum of the cost $C$, rounded to the nearest cent, required to build such a power line?
\[C=\$\answer{374899.96}\]
