\tag{derivative}

We have not yet fully justified the power rule $\frac{d}{dx} x^p = px^{p-1}$ for rational exponents $p$.  We can do this  using implicit differentiation.

Prove the integer power rule using the following outline:

\begin{itemize}
\item Consider $y = x^{\frac{n}{m}}$
\item Rewrite as $y^m = x^n$
\item Differentiate implicitly, using only the integer power rule
\item Substitute $y = x^\frac{n}{m}$ back into the expression
\item Simplify
\end{itemize}
