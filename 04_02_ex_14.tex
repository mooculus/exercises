\tag{related rates}


A hot air balloon lifts off from the ground rising vertically. From $100$ft away, a $5$ foot woman tracks the path of the balloon. When her sightline with the balloon makes a $45^{\circ}$ angle with the horizontal, she notes that the angle is increasing at $5^{\circ}$/min.

\begin{enumerate}
\item		What is the elevation, $h$, of the balloon at this moment? \[h=\answer{105}\,ft\]
\item		At what speed, $s$, is the balloon rising at this moment? \[s=\answer{\frac{50\pi}{9}}\,ft/min\]
\end{enumerate}
