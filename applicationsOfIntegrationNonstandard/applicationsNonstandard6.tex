\tag{integral}

A vase has a shape which can be described as a solid of revolution.
It is obtained by revolving the region bounded by $y=x^3$, the
$y$-axis, $y=0$, and $y=9$ about the $y$-axis.  All units are measured in inches.

Water is filling the vase at a rate of $2
\frac{\unit{in}^3}{\unit{s}}$.

At what rate is the height of the water increasing at the time when it
is $8$ inches high?

\begin{hint}
  At a given height $y$, we have that $x = y^{\frac{1}{3}}$.  Thus the
  disk with height $\d y$ at height $x$ has volume $\d V = \pi
  y^{\frac{2}{3}} \d y$
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
  Thus we have $\frac{\d V}{\d t} = \pi y^{\frac{2}{3}} \frac{\d y}{\d
    t}$
\end{hint}

\begin{hint}
  So at $y=8$, we have	
  \[
  2 = \pi 8^\frac{2}{3} \frac{\d y}{\d t}
  \]
  which implies
  \[
  \frac{\d y}{\d t} = \frac{1}{2\pi}
  \]
\end{hint}
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  \frac{\d y}{\d t} = \answer{\frac{1}{2\pi}} \unit{m}/\unit{s}
  \]
\end{prompt}
